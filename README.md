# Fluid channel modeling

This repository contains files for Python-based modeling of void fraction in microfluidic channels. Image data is located inside the *\data* directory. Models are created using *channel_modeling.ipynb*. Existing models are stored in the *\models* directory. The models can be reconstructed using *reconstruct_models.ipynb*.
