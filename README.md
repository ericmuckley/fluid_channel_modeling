# Fluid channel modeling

This repository contains files for Python-based modeling of void fraction in microfluidic channels. Image data is located inside the *\data* directory. Models of are created by running *channel_modeling.ipynb*. Once theey are created, models are saved in the *\models* directory. The models are then imported by *model_visualization.ipynb* for examination of the statistics in each model.

Shown below is an example of void fraction images and simulated model images.
