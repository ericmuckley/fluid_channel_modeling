# Fluid channel modeling

This repository contains files for Python-based modeling of void fraction in microfluidic channels. Image data is located inside the *\data* directory. Models are created using *channel_modeling.ipynb*, and models are saved in the *\models* directory. The models are then used to reconstruct the simulated void fraction configurations for each channel using *model_visualization.ipynb*..
