# Fluid channel modeling

This repository contains files for Python-based modeling of void fraction in microfluidic channels. Image data is located inside the *data* directory.


Models are created using *channel_modeling.ipynb*. Existing models can be reconstructed using *reconstruct_models.ipynb*.

Most recent channel models are stored in *json* format in *channel_models.json*.
